# Migrating from Docusaurus to Mintlify

**(Looking for help creating docs, or migrating your documentation? We love doing that at Ritza. Please reach out to gareth at ritza dot co if you'd like to discuss how we can make it painless for you.)**


[Mintlify](https://mintlify.com) allows users to create documentation using AI. In this tutorial you'll learn how you can migrate your documentation from Docusaurus to Mintlify

Here's an example of what you'll have

Docusaurus:

Mintlify:

## Prerequisites

- A Docusaurus project on Github
- NPM
- Git

## Migration steps overview

- Clone your Docusaurus project repo
- Change folder structure for Mintlify compatibility
- Change all .md files to .mdx
- Update imports and syntax in your .mdx files to sanitize it for Mintlify

## Clone Your Github repo and create a new branch

Copy the url of your Docusaurus project repo and run the following command in your terminal to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
```

Create and checkout a `mintlify-migration` branch to work on the migration

```bash
git chekout -b mintlify-migration
```

## Docausaurus folder structure vs. Mintlify

In your Docusaurus project your file structure probably looks something like this:

```bash
/your-project
├── /node_modules
├── /docs
│   ├── introduction.md
│   ├── getting-started.md
│   ├── /advanced
│   │   ├── deep-dive.md
├── /blog
├── /src
├── /static
├── /docusaurus.config.js
├── /sidebars.js
├── /package.json
├── /build
└── /README.md
```

For Mintlify, our structure needs to look like this:

```bash
/your-project
├── /node_modules
├── /docs
│   ├── /get-started
│   │   ├── introduction/
|            ├── introduction.mdx
├── /snippets
│   ├── ThemedImage.mdx
├── /img
├── mint.json
├── favicon.svg
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── README.md
```

Now let's look at how we can update the Docusaurus project to the Mintlify structure.

## Changing to Mintlify compatible file structure

There's a lot of stuff we won't need from Docusaurus project. You can delete `docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`, `/blog` and `/build`.

With Mintlify, each page is a `.mdx` file for example:

```bash
├── /docs
│   ├── /get-started
│   │   ├── introduction/
|            ├── introduction.mdx
```

In your project, change all your `.md` file extensions to `.mdx` and create parent folders with the same name as the `.mdx` file.

## Sanitizing .mdx files for compatibility

Now that we've changed our file extension we need to remove Docusaurus specific tags and imports. Tags like `:::note`, `:::tip` or `:::info` and imports like `@theme` will not work

### Tags

For tags, Mintlify provides alternatives called **Callout Boxes** like `<Notes> <Notes/>` for `:::note`. To use them first install the component package by opening your terminal and running:

```bash
npm install mintlify
npm install @mintlify/components
```

Now replace all Docusaurus tags in your `.mdx` files with Mintlify Callout Boxes. Use this [list of callout boxes](https://mintlify.com/docs/content/components/callouts) to find the callout box which best fits the tag you were using.

### Imports

To use imports in Mintlify create a `snippets/` folder in the root folder. Then add your snippet as a `.mdx` file.

for example, in a Docusaurus project to switch between images for dark and light modes we would import a component like this:

```bash
//Docusaurus

import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';

```

In Mintlify we create a `.mdx` snippet

```javascript
// snippets/ThemedImage.mdx

export const ThemedImage = ({ alt, sources }) => {
  if (typeof window === "undefined") {
    return null;
  }

  const isDarkMode = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches;

  return <img src={isDarkMode ? sources.dark : sources.light} alt={alt} />;
};
```

and import it like this:

```bash
//where-you-need-the-snippet.mdx

import { ThemedImage } from "/snippets/ThemedImage.mdx";

```

In some cases it is not possible to use an import, e.g for Docusaurus specific imports. In this case remove the import and where it is used. Find more information about imports and snippets in the [Mintlify import docs](https://mintlify.com/docs/reusable-snippets)

### Images

To use images, create a `img/` folder in your root directory and copy the images in your Docusaurus `static/` folder there.

### Comments

To use comments in Mintlify replace `<-- -->` with `/* */`

```bash
// Docusaurus
<-- Your Comment -->

//Mintlify
/* Your Comment */

```

### Text formatting

- To italicize text make sure your text ends with a closing `_`. For numbers you don't need to add `_` to signify a space.

```bash
// Docusaurus
_50,_00_0,_00_0

//Mintlify
_50 000 000_

```

- Where **`$$`** is used, replace with backticks ( ``` )

For more formatting options visit the [Mintlify text formatting docs](https://mintlify.com/docs/page)

These are just the main compatibility changes needed. If you need to use other components not compatible with Mintlify, look through the [Mintlify component library](https://mintlify.com/docs/content/components/) and update your project to use ones that best match your Docusaurus component.

## Running Mintlify locally

Once you've updated your documentation to the Mintlify format, you can test it locally by creating and configuring the `mint.json` file in the root directory of your project. Here's an example of what it might look like:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://mintlify.com/schema.json",
  "name": "Your Project Name",
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#YourPrimaryColor",
    "light": "#YourLightColor",
    "dark": "#YourDarkColor"
  },
  "favicon": "/path-to-your-favicon.svg",
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Get Started",
      "pages": ["/docs/intro", "/docs/setup"]
    },
    {
      "group": "Features",
      "pages": ["/docs/feature1", "/docs/feature2"]
    }
  ],
  "tabs": [
    {
      "name": "Get Started",
      "url": "/docs/intro"
    }
  ]
}
```

Here's an explanation of the properties

- **`$schema`**  
  The URL to the Mintlify schema for proper validation of the configuration.

- **`name`**  
  The name of your documentation project (e.g., `"IOTA Wiki"`).

- **`colors`**  
  Defines the primary color scheme of your documentation:

  - `primary`: The main accent color.
  - `light`: A lighter shade used for secondary elements.
  - `dark`: A darker shade used in themes or highlights.

- **`favicon`**  
  The path to the favicon file (a `.svg` file in your root directory ).

- **`navigation`**  
  Defines the structure of the navigation menu in your documentation:

  - `group`: Logical grouping of pages.
  - `pages`: The location of the folder of your specific .mdx page file

- **`tabs`**  
  Specifies additional tabs in your navigation bar:
  - `name`: Label displayed for the tab.
  - `url`: Corresponding URL for the tab’s content.

For Mintlify to recognize your pages you need to add them to the `navigation` property. For example if you have pages for `docs/introduction/introduction.mdx` and
`docs/faq/faq.mdx`
you would add:

```bash
  {
      "group": "Introducing",
      "pages": [
        "/docs/introduction",
        "/docs/faq"
      ]
    },
```

If you want to nest pages, recursively nest them within a group.

```javascript

"navigation": [
{
"group": "Group 1",
"pages": [
"Introduction",
{
"group": "Nested Reference Pages",
"pages": ["nested-reference-page 1", "nested-reference-page 2"]
}
]
}, {
"group": "Group 2",
"pages": [
"Group 2 points",
{
"group": "Nested Reference Pages",
"pages": ["nested-reference-page 1", "nested-reference-page 2"]
}
]
}
]
```

Add all your pages with the updated folder structure and sanitized files in the navigation property.

Once you've set up your `mint.json` file, run locally using :

```bash
mintlify dev
```

In the terminal you will also be notified of any compatibility issues, use them to make any adjustments needed.

If you have html in your `.mdx` files, you might encounter an error message like this when running locally:

```bash
⚠️ Parsing error: .\docs\learn\governance\the-shimmer-governance-framework.mdx:65:11 - Expected a closing tag for `</a>` (65:11-65:15) before the end
of `paragraph`
```

You can usually resolve them by trying to make sure the closing tag is on the same line as the opening tag.

Once everything is running. you can deploy using Mintlify

## Deployment

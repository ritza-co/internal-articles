# AWS vs Fly.io: Complete Platform Comparison for 2025

Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Fly.io represent two different approaches to cloud hosting. AWS is a comprehensive cloud platform offering hundreds of services with global infrastructure, while Fly.io specializes in edge computing with a focus on developer experience and containerized applications. This comparison examines both platforms across key factors to help you make an informed decision.

## Platform Overview and Core Philosophy

AWS launched in 2006 as a comprehensive cloud platform that offers over 200 services, from basic compute and storage to advanced machine learning and analytics tools. AWS operates through a vast global infrastructure with multiple availability zones across dozens of regions worldwide.

Fly.io takes a different approach, focusing specifically on edge computing and containerized application deployment. The platform deploys applications as individual Firecracker microVMs rather than traditional containers, providing enhanced isolation between applications. Fly.io emphasizes developer experience and global edge deployment for reduced latency.

## Pricing and Cost Structure

### AWS Pricing Model

AWS uses a pay-as-you-go model with multiple pricing options:

- **On-Demand Instances**: T2.micro instances start at $0.0058 per hour
- **Reserved Instances**: Up to 72% savings with 1-3 year commitments
- **Spot Instances**: Up to 90% discount using spare capacity
- **Savings Plans**: Flexible pricing with up to 72% savings
- **Free Tier**: 750 hours of t2.micro instances monthly for 12 months

Additional costs include:
- Public IPv4 addresses: $0.005 per hour (~$3.60/month) starting February 2024
- Data transfer: 100GB free monthly, then region-specific rates
- EBS storage: Varies by volume type and size

### Fly.io Pricing Model

Fly.io uses a simpler, per-second billing model:

- **Shared CPU instances**: Starting at $0.0027 per hour (~$1.94/month for 256MB)
- **Dedicated CPU**: Significantly higher, with 2 CPU/4GB costing ~$62/month
- **Reserved pricing**: 40% discount with annual commitments
- **Storage**: $0.15 per GB per month for persistent volumes
- **Outbound data**: $0.02 per GB in North America/Europe, up to $0.12 in other regions

Fly.io no longer offers a traditional free tier, but usage under $5/month is often waived for new accounts.

### Cost Comparison

For small applications, Fly.io often provides better value. A developer on Hacker News reported reducing costs from $70/month on AWS Lambda/API Gateway to $2/month on Fly.io. However, for dedicated compute resources, AWS typically offers better pricing at scale.

## Deployment and Ease of Use

### AWS Deployment Experience

AWS provides multiple deployment methods but comes with complexity:

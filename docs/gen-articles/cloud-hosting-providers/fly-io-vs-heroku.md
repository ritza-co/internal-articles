# Fly.io vs Heroku: Complete Platform Comparison for 2025

Both Fly.io and Heroku offer Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions that abstract infrastructure management from developers, but they take fundamentally different approaches to deployment, scaling, and pricing. This comprehensive comparison examines both platforms across key decision factors to help developers choose the right hosting solution.

## Platform Overview

**Heroku** launched in 2007 as one of the first PaaS offerings, built on Amazon Web Services infrastructure. It pioneered the concept of git-based deployments and has maintained its position as a developer-friendly platform with extensive add-on ecosystem. Heroku eliminated its free tier in November 2022 and now focuses on paid plans starting with Eco dynos.

**Fly.io** emerged as a modern alternative focused on edge computing and global deployment. The platform uses hardware-virtualized containers running on Firecracker microVMs across 35+ regions worldwide. Fly.io transitioned to a usage-based pricing model in October 2024, offering more granular control over infrastructure costs.

## Pricing and Cost Structure

### Heroku Pricing (2025)

Heroku's current pricing structure centers around dynos with different performance tiers:

- **Eco Dynos**: $5/month for 1,000 shared dyno hours across all apps. Dynos sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Basic Dynos**: $7/month per dyno, always-on with no sleep functionality
- **Standard-1x**: $25/month per dyno with 512MB RAM
- **Standard-2x**: $50/month per dyno with 1GB RAM
- **Performance-M**: $250/month per dyno with 2.5GB RAM
- **Performance-L**: $500/month per dyno with 14GB RAM

Additional costs include database add-ons (starting at $5/month for Postgres Hobby), and various third-party services through the Heroku marketplace.

### Fly.io Pricing (2025)

Fly.io operates on usage-based billing with the following structure:

- **Shared CPU**: Starting at approximately $0.0000077/second for shared-cpu-1x (256MB RAM)
- **Dedicated CPU**: Higher performance options with dedicated resources
- **Storage**: Volume pricing per GB-hour
- **Bandwidth**: Regional pricing varies, with increases implemented in phases starting July 2024
- **Free Tier**: 3 shared-cpu-1x machines and 3GB persistent volume storage for new accounts

The platform offers 40% discounts for reserved compute blocks and includes autostop/autostart functionality to reduce costs during low-traffic periods.

### Cost Comparison Analysis

For equivalent specifications, Fly.io typically costs significantly less than Heroku. A Standard-1x Heroku dyno ($25/month) with 512MB RAM equates to approximately $3.19/month on Fly.io when running continuously. However, Fly.io's usage-based model can lead to unpredictable costs at scale, particularly when adding regions or scaling resources.

## Deployment and Ease of Use

### Heroku Deployment Experience

Heroku maintains its reputation for deployment simplicity through git-based workflows:

- **Git Integration**: Push code directly via `git push heroku main`
- **Automatic Detection**: Platform automatically detects application type and configures buildpacks
- **Buildpack System**: Extensive library of official and community buildpacks for different languages
- **Pipeline Support**: Built-in CI/CD with review apps and staging environments
- **Add-on Provisioning**: One-click installation of databases, monitoring tools, and other services

### Fly.io Deployment Experience

Fly.io offers more infrastructure control while maintaining developer convenience:

- **Dockerfile-Based**: Applications packaged as Docker containers for consistent deployment
- **Automatic Generation**: CLI generates Dockerfiles for popular frameworks (Rails, Phoenix, Django, Node.js)
- **Configuration Management**: `fly.toml` files provide granular control over deployment settings
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Deploy applications across multiple regions with single command
- **Machine Management**: Direct control over individual machines and their configurations

Heroku provides a more streamlined experience for developers who prefer minimal infrastructure involvement, while Fly.io offers greater flexibility for teams comfortable with containerization concepts.

## Performance and Scalability

### Heroku Performance Characteristics

- **Dyno Architecture**: Applications run in isolated Linux containers on shared or dedicated infrastructure
- **Boot Times**: Standard application startup times without optimization
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling by increasing dyno count, vertical scaling by changing dyno types
- **Geographic Distribution**: Single-region deployment with optional multi-region add-ons
- **Sleep Behavior**: Eco dynos sleep after 30 minutes, causing cold start delays

### Fly.io Performance Characteristics

- **Firecracker MicroVMs**: Hardware-virtualized containers with approximately 300ms boot times
- **Global Edge Deployment**: Applications automatically deployed across 35+ regions
- **Anycast Routing**: BGP Anycast routes user requests to nearest geographic instance
- **Instant Scaling**: Machines start fast enough to handle individual HTTP requests
- **Always-On Option**: Machines can run continuously or scale to zero based on demand

Fly.io demonstrates superior performance for globally distributed applications requiring low latency, while Heroku performs adequately for regional deployments with traditional scaling patterns.

## Conclusion

Heroku and Fly.io represent different philosophies in Platform-as-a-Service offerings. Heroku continues to excel in developer productivity through abstraction, extensive add-on ecosystem, and mature enterprise features. However, its pricing structure can become expensive at scale, and geographic distribution options remain limited.

Fly.io offers compelling advantages for globally distributed applications through edge deployment, competitive pricing, and modern infrastructure primitives. The platform suits teams comfortable with containerization concepts and seeking infrastructure transparency. However, its smaller ecosystem and usage-based pricing model may present challenges for some development teams.

The choice between platforms ultimately depends on specific project requirements, team expertise, geographic distribution needs, and budget constraints. Heroku remains the safer choice for teams prioritizing simplicity and ecosystem maturity, while Fly.io appeals to developers seeking performance optimization and cost control in globally distributed applications.

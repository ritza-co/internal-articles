# Fly.io vs Railway: Complete Hosting Platform Comparison for 2025

Choosing between cloud hosting platforms requires careful consideration of pricing, performance, scalability, and developer experience. Fly.io and Railway represent two distinct approaches to application deployment: Fly.io focuses on global edge computing with extensive customization options, while Railway emphasizes developer experience with streamlined workflows. This comprehensive comparison examines both platforms across key decision factors to help you make an informed choice.

## Platform Overview

**Fly.io** operates as a global application platform built around lightweight Virtual Machines called Fly Machines. The platform specializes in edge computing, allowing applications to run close to users worldwide through its Anycast network infrastructure. Fly.io targets developers who need performance optimization, global distribution, and granular control over their deployment configuration.

**Railway** positions itself as a modern Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) focused on simplifying the deployment process. The platform automates infrastructure management while providing integrated development tools, environment management, and team collaboration features. Railway appeals to developers who prioritize rapid deployment and streamlined workflows over infrastructure customization.

## Pricing and Cost Structure

### Fly.io Pricing Model

Fly.io transitioned to a pay-as-you-go pricing model in October 2024, eliminating traditional fixed plans in favor of usage-based billing. The platform charges based on actual resource consumption:

- **Compute Costs**: Pricing varies by CPU and RAM configuration, with approximately $5 per GB of extra RAM for every 30 days
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes cost $0.15 per GB per month for provisioned capacity
- **Database Services**: Fly Postgres starts at $2-5 monthly for small instances, while high-availability setups can exceed $80 monthly
- **Bandwidth**: Outbound data transfer ranges from $0.02 per GB in North America/Europe to $0.12 per GB in other regions
- **Regional Pricing**: Implemented in phases through November 2024, with some regions carrying premium pricing

Basic web applications with 1 small VM, 1GB storage, and 50GB bandwidth typically cost $3-4 monthly. Fly.io often waives invoices under $5, making small applications effectively free to run.

### Railway Pricing Structure

Railway combines subscription fees with usage-based billing through multiple plan tiers:

- **Trial**: New users receive $5 in one-time credits for testing
- **Hobby Plan**: $5 monthly subscription includes $5 worth of usage; excess usage billed separately
- **Higher Tiers**: Professional and team plans with increased usage allowances and additional features

Railway's pricing starts at $5 monthly but applications stop running when trial credits are exhausted unless upgraded to a paid plan. The platform charges for RAM hours, CPU hours, and storage based on actual consumption.

## Deployment and Ease of Use

### Fly.io Deployment Process

Fly.io emphasizes a CLI-first workflow through the `flyctl` command-line tool. The deployment process involves:

- Local configuration through `fly.toml` files
- Manual application builds and deployments
- Direct infrastructure management through CLI commands
- Extensive customization options for advanced users

This approach provides significant control but requires familiarity with command-line tools and infrastructure concepts. The learning curve is steeper compared to web-based deployment platforms.

### Railway Deployment Experience

Railway prioritizes simplicity through its web-based interface and automated deployment pipeline:

- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic deployments triggered by repository pushes
- **Nixpacks Build System**: Automatic application detection and build configuration
- **Environment Management**: Built-in support for multiple environments (development, staging, production)
- **Preview Environments**: Isolated environments for every pull request
- **Template Directory**: One-click deployment of open-source projects

Railway's approach reduces setup time but provides fewer customization options compared to Fly.io's manual configuration process.

## Performance and Scalability

### Fly.io Performance Advantages

Fly.io's architecture focuses on performance optimization through several key features:

- **Global Edge Distribution**: Applications automatically deploy across multiple regions worldwide
- **CPU Options**: Choice between shared CPUs (cost-effective with burst capability) and performance CPUs (dedicated access)
- **Anycast Network**: Traffic automatically routes to the nearest available server
- **Manual Scaling**: Granular control over machine specifications and instance counts

Performance testing indicates consistent response times due to dedicated infrastructure, though machines may pause during periods of inactivity, resulting in cold start delays.

### Railway Performance Characteristics

Railway's performance model emphasizes reliability and uptime:

- **Always-On Applications**: No automatic scaling to zero, eliminating cold start issues
- **Automatic Scaling**: Limited compared to Fly.io but handles traffic spikes adequately
- **Single Region Focus**: Less emphasis on global distribution compared to Fly.io
- **Managed Infrastructure**: Platform handles performance optimization automatically

Railway provides consistent performance for applications that don't require global edge distribution but lacks the fine-tuned control available through Fly.io.

## Features and Capabilities

### Fly.io Feature Set

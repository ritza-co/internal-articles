# OpenAI is unpredictable at scale. Self-host instead.

Running an AI application on OpenAI's API feels straightforward at first. Sign up, get an API key, and start building. But as applications grow and process more requests, something uncomfortable happens: monthly bills become unpredictable and expensive in ways developers didn't anticipate.

Costs start with a few hundred dollars monthly, then multiply into thousands as usage scales. OpenAI charges per word - technically per token, but roughly equivalent, so monthly pricing is completely dependent on the highly unpredictable total number of words processed per month.

OpenAI controls every aspect of pricing beyond just per-token costs. Rate limits throttle requests during peak usage. Fine-tuning costs extra, context window limits force conversation truncation, and pricing changes happen at OpenAI's discretion.

This puts developers in an uncomfortable position: building applications on infrastructure they don't control, with costs they can't predict, from a [company that needs to dramatically increase revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/openai-sees-5-billion-loss-this-year-on-3point7-billion-in-revenue.html) to survive.

Meanwhile, the alternative - self-hosting large language models - has become much more practical than most people realize. An ecosystem of specialized tools like [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) provides complete control over model performance. Combined with predictable hardware-based pricing models, developers can often cut costs while gaining complete control over data and infrastructure.

## Pricing: OpenAI vs Self-hosted

Understanding how these two pricing models work helps explain why self-hosting becomes attractive as applications scale.

### How OpenAI pricing works

OpenAI charges based on tokens, which are pieces of words that their models process. One token roughly equals 4 characters or 0.75 words in English. This paragraph contains about 35 tokens that would cost money if sent to their API.

Current OpenAI pricing ranges from $0.15 per million input tokens for GPT-4o mini up to $15 per million input tokens for their most advanced o1 model. Output tokens cost 2-4 times more than input tokens.

Unpredictable pricing comes from several factors. Developers don't always know how many tokens users will generate - a simple question might result in a brief answer or a detailed explanation. Context length affects costs too, since the model processes previous conversation history with each new message. System prompts, error messages, and retry attempts all count toward token usage.

So you never know what the bill will be at the end of the month, its completely dependent on user behaviour is subject to usage spikes.

### How self-hosted pricing works

Self-hosting flips the economics completely. Instead of paying per token, applications pay fixed costs for hardware and hosting services, then process unlimited tokens within resource constraints.

With self-hosting, costs remain the same whether processing millions or billions of tokens, as long as staying within hardware capacity. This shift from variable to fixed costs changes how developers think about scaling applications.

Services like Cerebrium bridge the gap between traditional cloud hosting and full self-management. Cerebrium offers serverless GPU access where developers pay only for actual inference time, giving granular control over costs while maintaining the flexibility to scale. Applications can optimize batch sizes, implement custom caching strategies, and choose exactly which models to run on which hardware configurations.

The predictability comes from knowing costs upfront. [Developers can calculate](https://www.cerebrium.ai/pricing) exactly how much infrastructure will cost per month and plan accordingly. When more capacity is needed, hardware can be upgraded incrementally rather than facing sudden cost spikes from usage surges. Most importantly, developers control every aspect of the inference pipeline, giving full control over API optimization which directly effects pricing.

## How to self-host

The biggest misconception about self-hosting is that developers need to become infrastructure experts or invest hundreds of thousands in hardware. Modern tools and services have made self-hosting much more accessible.

The traditional approach required buying expensive NVIDIA GPUs, setting up data centers, hiring ML engineers, and managing complex software stacks. A production-ready setup could easily cost $300,000+ in hardware alone, plus ongoing operational costs.

But that barrier has largely disappeared. Serverless inference services now provide the infrastructure while developers focus on application logic. Production-ready LLM endpoints can be deployed in minutes rather than months, with automatic scaling and professional-grade reliability.

### Choosing hardware

Modern inference services abstract away most hardware decisions, but understanding the options helps optimize for cost and performance. Different GPU tiers offer different performance characteristics - entry-level options provide good performance at reasonable costs, while high-end GPUs deliver maximum throughput for demanding workloads.

Cerebrium offers hardware ranging from basic CPUs for simple tasks up to the latest high-performance GPUs for demanding workloads. The key is matching performance requirements to the most cost-effective hardware option rather than defaulting to the most powerful available.

### Choosing a model

Open-source models have reached impressive quality levels. Popular model families like Llama, Mistral, and others often perform comparably to proprietary offerings for many tasks while providing complete customization control.

Most model families come in multiple sizes, allowing developers to balance performance with resource requirements. Smaller models run efficiently on modest hardware while delivering strong quality for many applications. Larger models provide enhanced capabilities but require more substantial hardware investments.

Different model architectures excel at different tasks. Some models optimize for general language understanding, others for specific domains or languages, and advanced architectures like mixture-of-experts provide enhanced capabilities with efficient resource usage.

The choice depends on specific requirements for quality, latency, and cost. Applications can also run multiple models for different use cases - a smaller model for simple queries and a larger model for complex reasoning tasks.

### Improve inference

Raw model performance is just the starting point. Inference optimization can dramatically improve both speed and cost efficiency through techniques like quantization, batching, and caching.

Quantization reduces model memory requirements by representing weights in lower precision formats. This optimization can significantly reduce memory usage with minimal quality loss, allowing larger models to run on smaller hardware configurations.

Efficient batching processes multiple requests simultaneously, maximizing GPU utilization. Modern inference engines implement dynamic batching strategies that optimize throughput by intelligently grouping requests as they arrive.

Caching frequently requested content eliminates redundant processing. If multiple users ask similar questions, applications can serve cached responses instantly rather than regenerating them each time. Smart caching strategies can dramatically reduce both latency and computational costs.

### Upgrade hardware or models

Self-hosting provides flexibility to optimize setups as requirements change. Hardware can be upgraded to more powerful configurations during peak periods, then scaled back during quieter times. This elasticity is impossible with per-token pricing models.

Model upgrades become developer choice rather than external decisions. When a new version of Llama or Mistral releases, teams can evaluate whether the improvements justify updating their deployment. There's no forced acceptance of changes or paying higher prices for unwanted features.

Performance monitoring helps identify optimization opportunities. If applications consistently hit hardware limits, upgrading to more powerful GPUs might be cost-effective. If current setups are underutilized, scaling down saves money without affecting performance.

## Tools that make it easy

The infrastructure and tooling around self-hosting has evolved dramatically in recent years. What once required deep expertise in GPU programming and distributed systems can now be accomplished using high-level APIs and configuration files.

The open-source community has recognized that serving LLMs efficiently is a common problem that often requires specialized solutions. Rather than every organization building their own inference engines, tools have emerged to handle that complexity through easy-to-use interfaces.

### Optimize performance with vLLM and TensorRT-LLM

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) has become a leading open-source inference engine that solves LLM memory management. Its PagedAttention algorithm eliminates memory fragmentation hassles, achieving much more efficient memory usage.

The performance improvements are substantial. vLLM delivers significantly higher throughput than traditional serving methods and has been deployed at scale for services processing millions of requests daily.

TensorRT-LLM provides another high-performance option, particularly for NVIDIA GPU deployments. It achieves excellent latency performance through highly optimized CUDA kernels and tight integration with NVIDIA's software stack.

SGLang offers competitive performance with focus on simplicity and customization. [Cerebrium's benchmarks](https://docs.cerebrium.ai/v4/examples/benchmarking-vllm-sglang-tensorrt) show it can match or exceed other frameworks' performance while maintaining a cleaner codebase that's easier to modify for specific requirements.

### Migrate from OpenAI API

Modern inference engines like vLLM provide [OpenAI-compatible APIs](https://docs.cerebrium.ai/v4/examples/openai-compatible-endpoint-vllm), meaning developers can switch from OpenAI to self-hosted infrastructure by changing just two lines of code. Application logic, prompt engineering, and error handling remain identical.

This compatibility eliminates the technical risk of migration. Teams can deploy a self-hosted endpoint, run parallel tests comparing quality and performance, then gradually shift traffic without rewriting applications.

## Take pricing into your own hands

The convenience of OpenAI's API comes with a price - unpredictable costs that spiral as applications scale. This pricing model isn't well-suited for enterprise applications that need predictable budgets and reliable performance.

Self-hosting provides control. Applications get predictable pricing based on hardware costs, complete control over performance optimization, and the freedom to explore the growing ecosystem of powerful open-source models that just keep getting better.

Migration has never been easier thanks to OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Change two lines of code and applications run on self-hosted infrastructure with the same API they already use.

# What does \<x> actually do?

Often I come across a new piece of technology - a piece of software, a platform, a framework, whatever. For some reason I need to know what it does - maybe someone recommended it, maybe I want to compare it to something else, maybe I want to know if it can solve a specific problem I have.

But the landing page doesn't help. It says something like "GreatTool makes your life easy! It streamlines your workflows and allows seamless collaboration in your team so that you can focus on what really matters!" 

I read through the rest of the text, some sub pages, maybe even the documentation and I'm still confused.

Then I type "GreatTool vs " into Google and see what pops up as commonly searched for alternatives. If I know some of those, that helps ground the general area that this thing plays in at least. If not, then maybe some of those have clearer descriptions of WHAT THE FUCK THEY ACTUALLY DO.

Here's a collection of tools I've come across with plain language descriptions of what category of technology they belong to and what they do.
